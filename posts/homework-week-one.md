To start, I made the rough shapes as seen in https://www.onlysuddenly.com/

I made the rectangle, and circle.

From here, I tried to work on making the ball bounce across the screen. I accessed Code Train's video, 3.2: The Bouncing Ball - p5.js Tutorial, to experiment with how to do this.

Using this video I managed to get the ball to bounch horizonally. 

I then used this tutorial in order to make the ball bounce across all four walls of the canvas.
